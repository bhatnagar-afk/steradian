                    Our Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 1984 as an independent architectural practice in Moradabad,
                    our journey has been one of steady evolution and enduring vision.

                <p>
                    In 2021, we embraced the name <strong>Steradian Architects</strong> — inspired by the term <em>Steradian</em> (from the Greek <em>stereos</em>, meaning “solid,” and the English <em>radian</em>, a measure of angle). It reflects our pursuit of balance, precision, and spatial integrity in design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Steradian, we believe that design and construction are inseparable. Our <strong>Architect-Led Design + Build</strong> method ensures that each concept transitions into reality seamlessly — with integrity intact.
